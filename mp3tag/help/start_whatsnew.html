	<div>
		<a id="v301"></a><h1>Mp3tag v3.01</h1>

		<h2>Support for the WebM file format</h2>
		<p>
			This new version adds support for the WebM file format (file extension *.webm), a container
			format that is mainly used for video in the context of the web.
		</p>

		<h2>Feature "Adjust cover" to resize cover art</h2>
		<p>
			I've added the feature "Adjust cover", which I've introduced as action with the previous release,
			to the right-click context-menu of the cover art window.
		</p>

		<h2>Availability of freedb servers</h2>
		<p>
			The current operator of the public freedb servers announced to stop its services as of March 31, 2020.
			I've decided to not remove the freedb feature from Mp3tag for now, because it could be that alternative
			servers emerge from this situation.<br />
			If not, I can only recommend to use MusicBrainz. It's a high-quality alternative to freedb and is officially
			supported by Mp3tag.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			For a complete overview of all changes, please see the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">Changelog</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v300"></a><h1>Mp3tag v3.00</h1>

		<h2>Action "Adjust cover" to resize cover art</h2>
		<p>
			Many hardware players have certain limitations on the size of cover art and then it's
			sometimes just nice to scale down this 10000x10000 cover to a reasonable size. You can
			also use this action type to convert from JPEG to PNG or vice versa. It's quite handy
			and I hope it improves your workflow.
		</p>

		<h2>MusicBrainz tag sources with multiple search criteria</h2>
		<p>
			The MusicBrainz tag source now also offers two distinct search fields for album and artist and
			adds support for <code>MUSICBRAINZ_RELEASEGROUPID</code> along the way.
		</p>

		<h2>Accessibility related improvements</h2>
		<p>
			I've reworked most of the menu-drawing code in high-contrast modes so that it is now more in
			line with the native menus that the various supported versions of Windows are providing. Also,
			some buttons and menus were not accessible to screen readers &dash; if you're noticing something
			like that, please let me know.
		</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v299"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.99</h1>

		<h2>Updated MusicBrainz tag sources</h2>
		<p>
			MusicBrainz updated their server to a new search infrastructure and with that,
			some minor changes to the MusicBrainz tag sources were necessary.
		</p>

		<h2>Autumn Maintenance</h2>
		<p>
			This version also fixes a variety of issues which were reported during the past weeks.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>

	<div>
		<a id="v298"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.98</h1>

		<h2>Discogs tag sources with multiple search criteria</h2>
		<p>
			The existing album-only search for Discogs often produced too many results or results that were not totally relevant for the
			current search. This is why many users wished for multiple search criteria for metadata-lookup from Discogs. The current version adds
			new tag sources for Discogs and Discogs Cover Art, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>Search by Artist + Album</li>
				<li>Search by Artist + Title</li>
				<li>Search by Artist + Year</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Improvements for Web Sources Framework</h2>
		<p>
			The <a href="main_online.html">Web Sources Framework</a> now supports up to three different search criteria and
			has support for reusing tag sources to reduce code duplication.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>

	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v297"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.97</h1>

		<h2>Fixes regarding pasting cover art from clipboard</h2>
		<p>
			The previous version had an issue where pasting cover art was not possible anymore
			and I got many emails regarding this regression. I've decided to pull a hotfix release
			to make sure that as many people as possible are using the fixed version.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>

		</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v296"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.96</h1>

		<h2>Support for Opus with *.ogg file extension</h2>
		<p>
			So far, tagging <a href="https://opus-codec.org/">Opus</a> files required a *.opus file extension in Mp3tag. However,
			many applications are simply using Opus with the *.ogg file extension, which is perfectly valid. With this release, Mp3tag
			detects Opus for files with the *.ogg file extension &mdash; so no more renaming for you.
		</p>

		<h2>Improvements when copying cover art via clipboard</h2>
		<p>
			Mp3tag now also copies the original data next to an independent DIB format when copying cover art via the Windows clipboard.
			Previously, the independent DIB was re-encoded to a maximum quality JPEG, which was not the best option when the image was
			stored as, e.g., a PNG. Now, if you paste the cover to another file, the original format and data is used.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			I've also fixed many issues and performed many changes here and there.
			For a complete overview of all changes, please see the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">Changelog</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v295"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.95</h1>

		<h2>Toggling of file-list columns</h2>
		<p>
			You can now toggle file list columns via the context menu on the column header.
			This way it's easy to enable and disable columns you only need in certain conditions.
			It's a long-requested feature and I'm already using it quite often.
		</p>

		<h2>Nested action menus</h2>
		<p>
			If you're one of the aficionados of Mp3tag's action feature,
			you can now create nested action menus by using the # character
			in the action group name.
		</p>

		<h2>Support for subtracks at Discogs</h2>
		<p>
			The Discogs tag source now supports subtracks. I think it's great and it's
			probably most welcomed by people who have lots of classical music to tag.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			I've also fixed many issues and performed many changes here and there.
			For a complete overview of all changes, please see the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">Changelog</a>.

	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v294"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.94</h1>

		<h2>Support for discnumbers at auto-numbering wizard.</h2>
		<p>
			The auto-numbering wizard can now, optionally, also assign discnumbers to
			the selected files. New discs start when the directory changes.
		</p>

		<h2>History for Replace and Regexp actions</h2>
		<p>
			The actions 'Replace' and 'Replace with regular expression' now
			have a history drop-down that remember the previous inputs.
		</p>

		<h2>Remember inputs for last used Replace or Regexp quick actions</h2>
		<p>
			The quick actions 'Replace' and 'Replace with regular expression' now
			remember the last used inputs.
		</p>

		<h2>UI improvements at Tag Sources dialog</h2>
		<p>
			The tag sources dialog now has a splitter between the lists for results and files, which allows for resizing the lists individually without resizing the whole dialog.
			Also, the selection from the files list to results list is now synchronized.
		</p>

		<h2>Option to disable showing release notes on update</h2>
		<p>
			If you prefer to not have these notes shown when you update to a new version, you can
			disable displaying release notes for new versions at "Options > Updates".
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			I've also fixed many issues and performed many changes here and there.

	<div>
		<a id="v293"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.93</h1>

		<h2>Hotfixes regarding MP4 tagging</h2>
		<p>
			That was quick! v2.92 had some issues wrt. MP4 tagging and I've decided to pull a hotfix release
			to make sure that as many people as possible are using the fixed version.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v292"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.92</h1>

		<h2>Tag-Panel field size <em>Smaller</em></h2>
		<p>
			The Tag Panel continues to get love and it now has a new field size <em>Smaller</em> &mdash;
			which is smaller than <em>Small</em>. It’s perfect for track- and disc numbers and can be nicely
			combined with another <em>Smaller</em> and one <em>Medium</em>-sized field to fill up one row and
			use the available space in the most efficient way.
		</p>

		<h2>Configurable height of multiline fields on Tag-Panel</h2>
		<p>
			Many users who are using multiline fields on the Tag Panel (e.g., for displaying UNSYNCEDLYRICS)
			were asking for a way to configure the height of those fields. It's now possible to decide on
			the number of rows that are occupied by a multiline field (one row is the combination of
			label and input of a normal-sized field).
		</p>

		<h2>Advanced configuration option to toggle listing chapters as separate files</h2>
		<p>
			This new option gives the ability to decide of chapters are listed as separate files
			or are simply not listed.
			It's especially helpful if you're into editing video files (MP4 or Matroska) and
			always wanted to edit the  global tags of a file instead of the titles of the
			individual chapters.
			The option is located at "Options > Tags > Advanced" and is disabled by default.
		</p>

		<h2>Information fields for subsongs</h2>
		<p>
			Especially if the option to list chapter as separate files is disabled, it can be
			difficult to identify which files actually have chapters. I've added two new information
			fields to identify those files, <code>%_subsong_count%</code> provides the number of
			subsongs in a file and <code>%_subsong%</code> contains the subsong index.
		</p>

		<h2>Information fields for video dimensions</h2>
		<p>
			I have the impression that more and more users are also handling their video library
			with Mp3tag. This new version also has two new information fields for video dimensions,
			namely <code>%_video_width%</code> and <code>%_video_height%</code> for Matroska files
			(and MP4 video as well).
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			I've also fixed many issues and performed many changes here and there.
			For a complete overview of all changes, please see the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">Changelog</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v291"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.91</h1>

		<h2>Copying of individual tag fields</h2>
		<p>
			A long-awaited feature I've implemented is the ability to copy individual fields via the extended
			tag dialog at Alt+T. Just select the relevant fields you want to copy, right-click and choose the
			appropriate entry from the popup menu.
		</p>

		<h2>Default values for Tag-Panel fields</h2>
		<p>
			Tag-Panel fields have their default values back. Just better :)
			You can now configure a default value that is set whenever you select multiple files directly via the field
			configuration at <a href="options_tagpanel.html">Options &gt; Tag Panel</a>. Double-click on the desired field
			and choose the default value.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>

		<h2>Updated Code-Signing Certificate</h2>
		<p>
			I've updated the code-signing certificate that is used to digitally sign and verify the origin and integrity of
			Mp3tag's installer and executable.
		</p>

		<h2>Microsoft Store version</h2>
		<p>
			I've released Mp3tag to the Microsoft Store. It's still available for free and if you prefer getting your software
			from there you can give it a go.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			I've also fixed many issues with this release.
			For a complete overview of all changes, please see the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">Changelog</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v289"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.89</h1>

		<h2>Improved Tag Panel</h2>
		<p>
			I've made the following improvements to the Tag Panel:
			<ul>
				<li>many layout changes when displayed horizontally,</li>
				<li>all fields are now configurable (including default fields),</li>
				<li>added context menu to customize fields,</li>
				<li>added option to specify size when adding fields (normal, smaller, small, multiline),</li>
				<li>added dedicated separator field (_SEPARATOR) to allow for manual column breaks,</li>
				<li>added option to enable/disable fields, and</li>
				<li>added loading and saving of Tag Panel configurations.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Support for long file paths</h2>
		<p>
			Mp3tag now supports file paths longer than 260 characters, so also very wordy titles
			can be renamed properly.
		</p>

		<h2>Updated Discogs and MusicBrainz tag sources</h2>
		<p>
			Discogs changed their servers to require connections via TLS 1.2 (something very secure, if this sounds cryptic to you).
			I've added support for TLS 1.2 for Windows 7 and 8 (it's used by default starting from Windows 8.1). Unfortunately,
			TLS 1.2 is not available on Windows XP and Vista, so Discogs stops working on these systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			MusicBrainz updated their server to a new search infrastructure and with that,
			some minor changes to the MusicBrainz tag sources were necessary.
		</p>

		<h2>Updated MusicBrainz identifier mapping</h2>
		<p>
			I've added various internal mappings so that fields for MusicBrainz identifiers are now mapped to the correct
			fields (e.g., MUSICBRAINZ_ALBUMID is mapped to 'MusicBrainz Album Id').
		</p>

		<h2>Option to keep moved files in file list</h2>
		<p>
			With Mp3tag v2.87, I've implemented the unpopular change that moved files are always kept in the file list and can
			be manually removed. I've now made this behavior optional so that you can decide depending on your preferences.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			For a complete overview of all changes, please see the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">Changelog</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v288"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.88</h1>

		<h2>Going Deep</h2>
		<p>
			I've taken a deep dive in the bug reports section of the forums and fixed many, many long-lasting and not so old
			issues with this release.
		</p>

		<h2>Layout and other UI changes</h2>
		<p>
			I've reworked the layout of the Tag Panel in horizontal mode and changed Mp3tag to use a modern, default font in the main
			window. This one makes Mp3tag look more beautiful on modern Windows systems. This also implies, that any system-wide font
			changes are also visible in Mp3tag now.
		</p>

		<h2>Addressing memory above 2GB on 64 bit systems</h2>
		<p>
			This one is huge for people with huge libraries. Mp3tag can now allocate up to 4GB of your RAM.
			That's impressively much.
		</p>

		<h2>Displaying cover art dimensions in Mp3tag's file view</h2>
		<p>
			You can now use %_cover_width% and %_cover_height% for width and height of the first embedded cover art.
			It's also available in the filter, in the converters and everywhere else in Mp3tag.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>

	<div>
		<a id="v287"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.87</h1>

		<h2>Spring Maintenance</h2>
		<p>
			I've spent the last two months hunting bugs and issues and fixed many of them
			with the current release. Given the list of fixed issues, it feels like
			this is the most stable release of Mp3tag ever :)
		</p>

		<h2>MusicBrainz v2</h2>
		<p>
			The MusicBrainz v1 web service will be closed in a few months, so I've added a new
			official MusicBrainz Tag Source based on v2 of the MusicBrainz web service with this release.
		</p>

		<h2>Option to disable auto-filtering</h2>
		<p>
			The filter helper menu now has an option to enable/disable auto-applying the filter. This can be
			helpful if you're working with large libraries and find the auto-filtering to disturb your workflow.
		</p>

		<h2>LAME MP3 encoder version</h2>
		<p>
			I've rewritten the code to analyze MP3s with this version (it was sooooo old) and added detection
			of LAME encoder versions while I was at it. You can access it via the %_tool% information field, if
			this is something of interest to you.
		</p>

		<h2>Mapping of Matroska tag fields</h2>
		<p>
			I've reworked the tag fields mapping for Matroska and documented the process at the overview page for
			<a href="main_tags.html">Tag field mappings</a>. If you're tagging Matroska files, this is for you.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			It's quite a list for this version.
			You can get a complete overview via the
			<a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">history of changes</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v286"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.86</h1>

		<h2>Library to permanently store metadata</h2>
		<p>
			Normally, Mp3tag reads metadata from files when loading files, directories or playlists and stores the data in memory. Then,
			when you close Mp3tag, the data once read from the files is discarded and must be read again the next time you're working with
			those files in Mp3tag.
		</p>
		<p>
			This can become both time consuming and memory intensive, especially when dealing with large amounts of files. If you enable the
			Library in Mp3tag (see <a href="options_library.html">Options &gt; Library</a>), metadata is first read from the files and then
			stored in a database that resides in Mp3tag's configuration folder.
			On subsequent reads of the file, the metadata is read directly from the database and updated iff the file's modification timestamp
			has been changed. In addition to that, cover art or other binary data is not kept in memory but is stored in the database, which
			can reduce the amount of memory that is consumed by Mp3tag significantly.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a quite extensive change and required to rewrite huge parts of Mp3tag base layers. It's my hope that it improves performance and
			serves as a basis for interesting future improvements.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			This version also fixes many issues — some reported recently, some were a little bit older.
			You can get a complete overview via the
			<a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">history of changes</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v285"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.85</h1>

		<h2>Support for Matroska (MKA/MKV)</h2>
		<p>
			With the recent support for multi-track files, it was about time to add support for
			the Matroska container format. Similar to MP4, Matroska can contain both audio and
			video tracks. This means, that you now have another option to tag your video collection
			with Mp3tag. Mp3tag currently displays the default (or forced) audio track and all
			included chapters. I'm curious about your experience, so if you're going to use Matroska
			with Mp3tag please let me know what you think.
		</p>

		<h2>Extended list of default genres</h2>
		<p>
			I've extended the list of default genres to include all extensions made by Winamp (ID3v1
			genres 148 to 191) which were included by several other programs. It now includes genres
			like Audiobook and IDM which I find quite nice. If you're using only a small set of genres,
			you can use 'Options &gt; Genres' to add your own.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>

	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v284"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.84</h1>

		<h2>Support for Nero-style MP4 chapters</h2>
		<p>
			MP4 is a container format — which basically means that you can put loads of stuff into it.
			With Nero-style tags, it’s even possible to have one file consisting of multiple sub-tracks.
			The Nero chapter tags describe the position and the sub-track specific tags. With this new
			version, Mp3tag displays individual sub-tracks of such files and also allows for editing
			of those individual chapter tags. Tags fields with the same contents across all sub-tracks
			are used as global file tags when writing changes.
		</p>

		<h2>Cover-only Tag Sources to import album-art from Discogs</h2>
		<p>
			Many of you wrote me and wished for a cover-only alternative to the now discontinued Amazon
			Tag Sources. Here you go :) With this new version, Mp3tag comes with two cover-only Tag Sources
			to import cover art from Discogs.
		</p>

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		<p>
			This version fixes many, many issues — some reported recently, some were a little bit older.

	<div>
		<a id="v283"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.83</h1>

		<h2>Support for querying Discogs via Release ID</h2>
		Sometimes, searching by album or artist name simply doesn't give the correct results. This version
		adds a new tag source to directly search by Discogs Release ID. This means, that you can directly
		jump to the correct result when importing tags from Discogs.com.

		<h2>Import from Amazon no longer available</h2>
		Unfortunately, Amazon has closed my associate account so that importing tags via Amazon is no longer
		possible. A highly recommended alternative tag source is Discogs, which offers high-quality metadata
		and cover art.

		<h2>Support for removing Nero-style tags from MP4 files</h2>
		Nero-style tags are one possible reason why tags cannot be saved to MP4 files. This version
		adds basic detection of those tags and reporting via %_tag% if present. Furthermore, you can now remove
		Nero-style chapter information from MP4 files via context-menu in the file list.

		<h2>Support for restricting cover export to certain cover types</h2>
		The Mp3tag action to export cover-art to files now has a option to restrict the covers to be exported to
		a certain cover type. This means, that you can now export, e.g., all the front covers of your files in one go.

		<h2>Improvements at reading and writing cue sheets</h2>
		It's now possible to read cue sheets that don't start with Track 1 and many other things. If you're into working
		with cue sheets, you'll probably like the changes in this release.

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		Furthermore, this version fixes some issues which were reported during the last months
		as denoted in the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">history of changes</a>.

	<div>
		<a id="v282"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.82</h1>

		<h2>Spring Maintenance</h2>

		<p>
			This version is a spring-cleaning maintenance release and fixes issues which were reported during the past weeks.
		</p>

		<p>Please see the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">history of changes</a> for a complete list.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v281"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.81</h1>

		<h2>Support for Portable Installation and Admin-Elevation</h2>
		A long-requested feature of many users was a portable installation of Mp3tag, i.e., a installation
		that installs in one directory and also stores its configuration settings in this directory. This
		is now possible. And if you choose the standard installation, Mp3tag automatically elevates the
		process to the necessary user rights (after asking you, of course).

		<h2>Support for iTunes Grouping Field</h2>
		As mentioned in the release notes of Mp3tag v2.80, iTunes was writing the grouping information
		to its internal database only. With an updated version of iTunes, this information is now written
		to a new iTunes-specific ID3v2 field which is available in Mp3tag via the field name GROUPING.

		<h2>Further changes</h2>
		Furthermore, this version fixes some issues which were reported during the last months
		as denoted in the <a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">history of changes</a>.

	<div>
		<a id="v280"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.80</h1>

		<h2>Support for iTunes tag fields for classical music</h2>
		In October, iTunes introduced new tag fields for better tagging of classical music. Those fields include
		work name, movement name, number and total count and are mapped in Mp3tag to these new field names:
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>MOVEMENTNAME &mdash; Movement name</li>
			<li>MOVEMENT &mdash; Movement number</li>
			<li>MOVEMENTTOTAL &mdash; Movement count</li>
			<li>WORK &mdash; Work name</li>
			<li>SHOWMOVEMENT &mdash; Flag to trigger showing of classical fields instead of normal title in iTunes (1 = yes)</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		While the implementation of these fields in iTunes is not yet realized completely consistent, Mp3tag supports all
		fields for MP4 tags. For MP3 files, iTunes currently writes the work name to the CONTENTGROUP field (while what's
		added at "Grouping" is only stored in iTunes' internal database). The same applies to the flag SHOWMOVEMENT which
		is also stored in iTunes' internal database and not in the file itself. There are already several bug reports for
		that reported to Apple and I expect a consistent implementation with the next release of iTunes.

		<h2>Support for AIF / AIFF audio format (*.aif, *.aifc, *.aiff)</h2>
		The main feature of v2.78 is full support for the AIF / AIFF audio format. This includes support for ID3v2 tags
		(including user-defined fields and cover art) as dedicated RIFF chunks.
		The new version reads, writes and removes those tags and – as usual – also reports meaningful technical
		information about the file.

		<h2>Support for iTunes MP4 owner information</h2>
		This version adds support for the ITUNESOWNER field, which shows the owner of an MP4 file which has been bought via the iTunes Store. Besides
		ITUNESACCOUNT, this enables you to make sure that all files are from your own music library. Please note that removing those fields doesn't remove
		the (hidden) buyer information from the file.

		The new version reads, writes and removes those tags and – as usual – also reports meaningful technical
		information about the file.

		<h2>Support for HTTPS in Web Sources Framework</h2>
		Since more an more APIs are changing their access methods to require authentication or to be HTTPS-only, this version
		adds support for secure connections to web sources via HTTPS. This is a rather huge change since the complete HTTP connection
		part has been replaced in the course of this update.

		<h2>Discogs access via HTTPS</h2>
		As a prominent example of the changes described above, Discogs announced to be available via HTTPS only starting from March 14.
		The official Discogs web source of Mp3tag has been updated to use HTTPS with this update. In the background, I've already changed
		the Mp3tag Discogs image cache that is used to provide Discogs images to Mp3tag users to use HTTPS as well.

		<h2>Support for Podcast Keywords</h2>
		Mp3tag becomes more and more popular in the podcast community and already supports a variety of podcast-related tag fields
		(e.g., podcast category, podcast description, podcast ID and podcast URL). This version adds support for podcast keywords via the
		PODCASTKEYWORDS field for ID3v2 and MP4 tags.

		<h2>Compatibility Improvements for ID3v2 Comments</h2>
		When it comes to ID3v2 comments, iTunes and Windows Media Player seem not to like each other very much. While iTunes requires the
		ID3v2 comment language to be set to 'eng' (English), Windows Media Player and Windows Explorer need the comment language set to
		the language of the Windows version that is running. Otherwise, the comments are simply not shown in these applications. In the
		past Mp3tag offered a quite tedious via editing the language file to circumvent these compatibility issue. With this version, the
		ID3v2 comment language can be set via a configuration dialog which is available via 'Options &gt; Tags &gt; Advanced' and will
		preserved also when installing new versions of Mp3tag. So no more fiddling in the language files for you.

		<h2>Automatically Select Files</h2>
		In the past, many users have wished for an option to automatically select files that have been added to Mp3tag's file list.
		With this version, I've added a new configuration option to 'Options > General' that allows for automatically selecting files.
		When this option is enabled, files that are loaded when Mp3tag started or are added via drag'n'drop or are added via the right-click
		option in Windows Explorer are selected automatically.

		<h2>Selecting All Files via Toolbar</h2>
		Some users prefer working via keyboard shortcuts, others are effectively using the mouse. To select all files, the most efficient way
		was to use the Ctrl+A keyboard shortcut. This might change now, especially for the mouse users amongst you, because the current version
		now features a new toolbar button for selecting all files in Mp3tag's file list.

		<h2>File Selection when Filtering Files</h2>
		Till now, the file selection was not preserved when switching from a filter result to the complete file list via F3
		or 'View > Filter...'. This had the significant drawback, that files which were identified using the filter and selected
		in the filtered file list, were not seen in context of the complete file list anymore once the filter has been reset. With
		this version, the file selection is preserved when disabling the filter.

		<h2>New Bit-Depth Information Field</h2>
		Some audio formats offer encoding in different bit depths. This information is now available using the %_bitspersample% information
		field for audio formats that support different bit depths.

		If you find any quirk or think you've found a bug please let me know.

		<h2>Updated Code-Signing Certificate</h2>
		To verify the integrity and the origin of the Mp3tag setup and Mp3tag program file, I've updated the code-signing certificate.

		<h2>DPI Awareness and High DPI Support</h2>

		<p>
			To be honest, when I first saw a screenshot of Mp3tag on a high-resolution 4K screen I had to laugh: the toolbar
			icons were ridiculously small and also other screen elements were drawn too small &mdash; while the app was
			still usable in itself. At that point I didn't knew yet, what it takes to make an app fully DPI aware.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the last month I worked on making Mp3tag more DPI aware and touched all the different code parts of drawing
			and moving user-interface elements. It was quite a ride and it took me to places in Mp3tag's code base which I
			hadn't visited for a long time.
		</p>

		<p>
			Furthermore, I've redrawn the toolbar icons in 32x32 and 24x24 sizes. I'm not
			an icon designer so it took me some time to get it done. I did a lot of experiments (even with flat black and white
			icons) but ended up with a set which sticks very much to the original icons which you (&mdash; and I) are already
			familiar with. But some icons changed their face or got a new finishing and I hope you like it.

		Since Discogs implemented rate-limiting on images requests through their API, users of
		the Discogs Web Source experienced quite often, that no images were provided by the web
		source&mdash;1000 request per day for all users of Mp3tag is simply not enough.
		<p>
			Over the last weeks, we've implemented a Discogs image cache on the Mp3tag servers which
			is now asked for images before the actual Discogs servers. This first reduces load on the
			Discogs servers, but also increases the chance that more and more images are served to you.

		<h2>Discogs API changed to JSON</h2>
		Yet another Discogs-related change, you might be thinking&mdash;at least we did, when
		we read the corresponding announcement on their API development forums :-)
		This change removed the XML format from the API and changed the API format to JSON, which resulted in
		the official Discogs Tag Source not working anymore for you.
		<p>
			With this release, we have developed a new official Discogs Tag Source based on the new JSON format.
			This new format also is more robust w.r.t. changes in the API. If you notice any quirks, releases that
			cannot be tagged or other things, please let us know.
		</p>

		<h2>JSON-related functions for Web Sources Framework</h2>
		We've extended the <a href="main_online.html">Web Sources Framework</a> by JSON-related functions that enable the development of faster,
		more reliable, and easier to maintain Tag Sources. We're looking forward to any community-based development
		in this area!

		<h2>Discogs API access changed to OAuth</h2>
		Starting at August 15, 2014 Discogs restricts access to their API to authentication
		using OAuth. As a user of the Discogs Tag Source you need to have an account on the
		Discogs web site. If you don't have a user account yet, you can create a free account
		on the discogs web site via
		<p>
			<a href="https://www.discogs.com/users/create">https://www.discogs.com/users/create</a>
		</p>

		When you use any of the Discogs Tag Sources from Mp3tag, Mp3tag will ask you to
		authorize access to your Discogs profile. You'll then have to authorize the Mp3tag application
		on your Discogs profile and enter the authorization code when Mp3tag is asking you to do so.

		not being retrieved while using the discogs tag source. The access to the
		Discogs API has been fixed with this release.

		<h2>Internal Restructuring</h2>
		While this is not a feature that is visible to the user, it's worth mentioning that
		over the last weeks we did some major refactoring of Mp3tag's code base by changing
		to use standard container libraries and algorithms.

		<h2>Improved performance when reading MP4 files</h2>
		Mp3tag now reads MP4 files faster than before which should be significant
		on large collections (many files) or collections including MP4 video (large files).

		<h2>Improved compatibility of YEAR in ID3v2.3</h2>
		With Mp3tag v2.53 released almost one year ago we decided to combine
		the release year (ID3v2.3 frame TYER, displayed as YEAR) and release
		date (ID3v2.3 frame TDAT, displayed as DATE) in YEAR and display it
		as YYYY-MM-DD. The intention was to improve compatibility with other
		applications and the ID3v2 standard.<br /><br />
		Since then we've received numerous support requests both on the
		<a href="http://forums.mp3tag.de">Mp3tag Forums</a> and via email from
		users who are unsatisfied with that change. Either because they use a
		different formatting of date values, use some value denoting a specific
		time frame (e.g., the 80s) or simply wanted to preserve values that
		were not fitting in the new date formatting scheme.<br /><br />
		With Mp3tag v2.58 we revert this change to the previous behavior.

		<h2>Improved support for Drag &amp; Drop of cover art</h2>
		Mp3tag now uses a different method for drag &amp; drop of cover art
		which does not require re-encoding the cover image again but instead
		uses the original image whenever possible. In addition, support for
		drag &amp; drop of cover art from Google Chrome has been added.

		<h2>Improved compatibility of YEAR in ID3v2.3</h2>
		The release year (ID3v2.3 frame TYER, displayed as YEAR) and release
		date (ID3v2.3 frame TDAT, displayed as DATE) are now combined in YEAR
		and displayed as YYYY-MM-DD. This improves compatibility with other
		applications (e.g., foobar2000) and provides a consistent view with
		all revisions of the ID3v2 specification.

		<h2>Option to specify cover art directory</h2>
		With this option located at 'Options &gt; Directories' you can specify a default directory
		that is displayed when adding cover art. Besides fully-qualified path names, you
		can provide relative path names and use placeholders. If no default directory is specified
		or the directory cannot be opened, Mp3tag opens the directory of the first selected file
		iff it contains cover art or the current working directory in all other cases.

		<h2>Converter Tag &mdash; Tag</h2>
		This converter formats tag fields by other fields content, which means that
		you can use it to copy tags from one field to another or to combine contents
		of multiple different tag fields in one tag field. As already known from the
		other <a href="main_converter.html">converters</a>, you can use
		<a href="main_converter.html#ttf">placeholders</a> for any tag field and
		<a href="main_scripting.html">scripting functions</a> within the format string
		to format the content of the specified tag field.<br />
		Furthermore, the format string is evaluated while typing and you can verify the
		results using the built-in preview.

		<h2>Unicode Playlists in UTF-8 format</h2>
		You can now save playlists in Unicode format encoded as UTF-8 if you use *.m3u8
		as file extension. This can be useful if file names contain special characters.
		Applications which support UTF-8 encoded playlists are, e.g., Apple iTunes and
		foobar2000.

		<h2>Discogs API 2.0</h2>
		Discogs.com released a completely redesigned API for accessing data from their
		website based on the popular JSON format. Mp3tag's web source framework and the
		corresponding discogs web source have been updated to this new format.
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v249"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.49</h1>

		<h2>Support for unknown MP4 tags</h2>
		Previous to this version, MP4 tags that were unknown to Mp3tag were deleted
		from the files, which was an issue for some users. With this version, Mp3tag
		keeps those unknown MP4 tags (also called atoms).

		<h2>Support for wildcards at cover import from file</h2>
		The actions <strong>Import cover from file</strong> and <strong>Import text file</strong>
		now support wildcards * (matches zero to many characters) and ? (matches exactly one character).
		This should ease cover import from randomly named files significantly.

		<h2>Updated Web Sources</h2>
		The MusicBrainz and discogs Web Sources are now both based on the corresponding web service API
		which makes them more robust to changes on the respective web sites.

	<div>
		<a id="v248"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.48</h1>

		This version is mainly a maintenance release which updates the Amazon Web Sources

		As soon as enough users updated to this new release, the request limit enforced by Amazon
		should not be an issue anymore.
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v247"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.47</h1>

		<h2>Tag fields renamed</h2>
		With this release some of the tag fields that are used for format strings, actions,
		columns, exports, and filters are renamed to have more accessible and intuitive names.
		This also means that all parts of Mp3tag where you have used the old names have to
		be updated. We know that this is an invasive change but think that it was a step necessary to
		keep it everything maintainable and understandable for new users of the program.<br />
		Please see the list below for details on the renamed tag fields:
		<ul>
			<li>BAND to ALBUMARTIST</li>
			<li>ALBUMSORTORDER to ALBUMSORT</li>
			<li>ARTISTSORTORDER to ARTISTSORT</li>
			<li>BANDSORTORDER to ALBUMARTISTSORT</li>
			<li>COMPOSERSORTORDER to COMPOSERSORT</li>
			<li>TITLESORTORDER to TITLESORT</li>
			<li>TVSHOWSORTORDER to TVSHOWSORT</li>
			<li>ITUNESCOMPILATION to COMPILATION</li>
			<li>ITUNESPODCAST to PODCAST</li>
			<li>ITUNESPODCASTCATEGORY to PODCASTCATEGORY</li>
			<li>ITUNESPODCASTDESC to PODCASTDESC</li>
			<li>ITUNESPODCASTID to PODCASTID</li>
			<li>ITUNESPODCASTURL to PODCASTURL</li>
		</ul>
		Some of them might be familiar to you, others might be new. If you are wondering
		which other fields are available, please see <a href="main_tags.html">Names of tag fields</a>
		for a complete list.

		<h2>Actions menu</h2>
		The actions feature which was well hidden under the converter menu now has a
		dedicated top-level menu where all action groups are accessible via menu items.
		If you are not familiar with the actions in Mp3tag please have a look at the
		<a href="options_format.html">Actions help page</a>. It is a powerful feature and
		worth looking at.

		<h2>Amazon</h2>
		Amazon has limited access to their web service to 2000 requests per hour. That means
		that you might get an occassional error 503 when using the Amazon tag source. However,
		the limit is reset each hour so you can try again later if it is not working for you.
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v246"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.46</h1>

		<h2>Explorer Shell Extension</h2>
		The right-click menu extension is now realized by a dedicated Shell extension
		which improves opening files and directories via the context menu also for large
		amounts of files.

		<h2>Improved user-defined field mappings</h2>
		The user-defined mappings for field names introduced in Mp3tag v2.45 now have an
		own <a href="main_mapping.html">help page</a> and were further improved with regard
		to mapping multiple field names to one user-defined field name.

		<h2>Improved Tag Sources dialog</h2>
		The Tag Sources dialog now also supports reordering of files via drag and drop
		allowing to quickly rearrange files according to the titles. Yes, we made it work
		with multiple files too :-)
		The sorting and selection state of the Tag Sources search results are now also
		remembered if you decide to go back and pick another result.

		<h2>Portable settings</h2>
		Previous versions of Mp3tag stored toolbar and panel positions in the Windows Registry.
		This changed with this release so that Mp3tag now stores all configuration data in its
		own configuration files.
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v245"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.45</h1>

		<h2>Improved Filter</h2>
		The filter now supports <a href="main_filter.html">filter expressions</a> where it is now
		possible to combine filter criteria and use format strings for filtering. The filter now
		also comes with a history, providing easy access to your often-used filter expressions.

		<h2>User-defined field mappings</h2>
		Mp3tag now supports user-defined mappings for field names. This is particularly useful
		in case you need to make field names consistent across different types of tags.
		The feature is available via
		'Options &gt; Tags &gt; Mapping' where you can create mappings for a specific tag type
		(APEv2, ID3v2, MP4, VorbisComment or WMA), provide a Source name (Mp3tag's internal name)
		and a target name (your preferred field name).

		<h2>Multiline fields for Tag Panel</h2>
		Are you adding lyrics, artist biographies or other text-intensive information to your songs?
		If so, you can now add multiline custom fields to the Tag Panel via
		<a href="options_tagpanel.html">Options &gt; Tag Panel</a>.
	</div>

	<div>
		<a id="v243"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.43</h1>

		<h2>Automatic Updates</h2>
		This version comes with support for automatic checking for updates on program startup. You
		can decide whether you want to get notified on stable final releases only, or whether you
		want the freshest stuff from our compilers (Beta versions). If you don't want Mp3tag to check
		for updates you can disable it completely at 'Options > Updates'.

		<h2>Horizontal Tag Panel</h2>
		While it was always possible to drag the Tag Panel and dock it above or below
		Mp3tag's file list, the input fields are now arranged more effectively. It's also
		possible to disable the directory switcher from the Tag Panel.

		<h2>New Translations</h2>
		Mp3tag is now also translated to Danish, Hebrew, Vietnamese, and Ukranian language.

	<div>
		<a id="v234"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.34 - Support for cover art / Import from Amazon.com</h1>

		<h2>Support for cover art</h2>
		With the new release Mp3tag supports embedded cover art for files with ID3v2 tags, TTA- and WMA files.
		You can add cover art via the <img src="images/mt_tag.png" alt="extended tag dialog" /> extended tag dialog at <span class="menu">View &gt; Extended Tags...</span>
		or <span class="hotkey">Alt</span> + <span class="hotkey">T</span>.

		<h2>Import from Amazon.com</h2>
		Besides the freedb support, Mp3tag now has the ability to get album information from Amazon.com. Just
		choose the small arrow from the right of the Icon <img src="images/mt_freedb.png" alt="freedb" /> and
		select <strong>Amazon.com</strong>. You'll get a list of matching items and can choose the
		album to import the tags (and cover art).<br />
		<br />
		The Amazon.com import uses Mp3tag's incredible web source framework. There are even more web sources
		available at the <a href="http://forums.mp3tag.de/index.php?showtopic=1794">Web Source Archive</a> on the
		Mp3tag forums.

	<div>
		<a id="v233"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.33 - Support for Unicode</h1>
		Probably the most import change and new feature in this version is the support for Unicode through
		the whole program. Mp3tag writes ID3v2 tags in Unicode format (UTF-16) by default now, but there are
		still some programs, portables or car radios which have problems with ID3v2 tags stored in Unicode format
		(though this is specified within the ID3v2 standard). To use Mp3tag with this programs or devices, simply
		enable the option <strong>Always write ISO-8859-1 tags instead of UTF-16</strong> at
		<strong>Options &gt; Tags &gt; Mpeg</strong>. After that, just save the tags again by clicking
		<img src="images/mt_save.png" alt="File &gt; Save tag" /> or by using the
		<span class="hotkey">Ctrl</span> + <span class="hotkey">S</span> hotkey.<br />
		<br />
		If you have problems displaying tags with characters from other charsets (like Cyrillic) in Mp3tag, the
		tags are probably stored in a system codepage instead of Unicode or ISO-8859-1. To convert these tags
		from a specific codepage to Unicode, simply create a new action <span style="color:green">Convert codepage</span>,
		select the appropriate tag field(s) and choose the codepage from the drop-down list.

		<a id="v227"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.27 - New syntax for scripting functions</h1>

		The last versions had major problems with the backslash and the double quotes characters
		within scripting functions so we had to reimplement the part which is responsible for
		evaluating the built in functions.<br />
		The names of the functions did not change - you don't have to learn new function names
		or placeholder names.

		<h2>What has changed?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>There is no need to put parameters of function in double quotes anymore.</li>
			<li>There is no need to leave the $ character from nested function calls.</li>
			<li>There are (hopefully) no problems with backslashes and double quotes anymore.</li>
			<li>The scripting functions $meta and $join are obsolete now.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Are there any special characters with specific functionality/limitations?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><code>[ ... ]</code> Displays contents of brackets only if at least one of fields referenced inside has been found.</li>
			<li><code>'</code> Outputs raw text without parsing. This will output the contained string and ignore all reserved characters (%,$,[,]) in it.</li>
